## Intellectual property

This topic makes clear which party owns the [intellectual property](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/intellectual_property.md) in the product delivered by the contractor to the customer.

There are 3 options.

**The first option** gives the contractor ownership of the intellectual property that it creates â€“ the customer has the right to use it under a licence.

This option is advantageous to the contractor, since as owner of the intellectual property, they can reuse it for future customers.

**The second option** creates a split between:
- intellectual property owned by the contractor before the agreement; and
- intellectual property created for the customer under this agreement.

This option does not allow the contractor to reuse new intellectual property created for future customers.

**The third option** transfers the ownership of all the code to the customer. This option should be used when the contractor uses none of their existing code for the services.

### Contractor will own all the intellectual property in the Services IP and licenses the Customer to use it.
