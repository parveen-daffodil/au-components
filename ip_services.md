## Intellectual property

This topic makes clear which party owns the [intellectual property](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/intellectual_property.md) (sometimes known as IP) in the product created by {{party 1}}. IP is often a **big source of value**, so it is important to be clear about ownership and use of IP.

There are 2 options.

**The first option** creates a split where:
- {{party 1}} owns the existing background IP; and
- {{party 2}} owns the new IP.

Under **the second option** {{party 1}} keeps ownership of the intellectual property that it creates for {{party 2}}, but {{party 2}} can use the intellectual property under a licence.  This option is really good for {{party 1}}, because it allows {{party 1}} to re-use the same work for future customers.

### {{party 2}} will own New IP.

- {{party 1}} [transfers ownership of the intellectual property rights](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-ip_transfer/blob/e1f03c73bd15e8ddfa281aeff129154f734eff71/au-ip_transfer.md) in the New IP to {{party 2}}, with the exception of any Background IP.
- {{party 1}} grants a licence to {{party 2}} to the Background IP as described in the table below.

### {{party 1}} will own the New IP and ({{party 2}} will get a licence to use it.

- {{party 2}} [transfers ownership of the intellectual property rights](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-ip_transfer/blob/e1f03c73bd15e8ddfa281aeff129154f734eff71/au-ip_transfer.md) in the New IP to {{party 1}}.
- {{party 1}} grants a licence to {{party 2}} to use the New IP as described in the table below.
