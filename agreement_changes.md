## Agreement changes

If you're using an agreement for a large number of people, sometimes it's a good idea to reserve the right to let everyone know about a change in the agreement by email. Notifying everybody at once means it's a lot less hassle to update the terms.

### Contractor can update the Agreement with an email to the Customer.

- Contractor may amend the Agreement (including any amounts payable for the Services) by notifying the Customer in writing {{change notice}} before the end of a Term.
- If Customer does not agree to the Agreement amendments, Customer must cease using the Services.

## Parties need to amend the agreement in writing.

The parties may only amend the Agreement in writing.
